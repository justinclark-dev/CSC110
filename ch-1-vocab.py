    A low-level programming language is one which operates directly on the hardware.

# Convert the following numbers from base 10 to base 2. Show your work:

44>sub_10	21>sub_10
# State in your own words the class policy on copying code from another student? (You can find this information on the course syllabus; be sure to read the whole syllabus carefully.)
    Not recommened for the purpose of learning, and if turned in as if it were there own... not allowed!

## NOTE: Most lab deadlines are set at 11pm on the day of the lab meeting.  When electronic submission is required, this is the actual deadline.  When the submission is on paper (as it is for this lab), the worksheet must be turned in no later than the very beginning of the next class meeting.  So, for this lab, be sure to turn in your completed worksheet at the end of lab, or at the very latest at the beginning or our next class meeting.  A complete solution will be posted after that.
