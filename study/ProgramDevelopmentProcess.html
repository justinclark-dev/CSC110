		<center><i><br>
		&quot;The sooner you start coding your program, the longer it's going to 
		take.&quot; </i>-
		Henry Ledgard<br>
&nbsp;</center>
		<p>Writing Python statements (&quot;coding&quot;) is only one part of the process 
		of developing a computer program. Here is one way to view the entire 
		program development process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>ANALYZE</b> the problem -- clearly define the problem and 
			ensure that it is fully understood. Determine the required <b>input</b> 
			and <b>output</b>.</li>
			<li><b>DESIGN</b> the solution to the problem -- that is, develop an
			<b>algorithm</b> that will solve the problem. </li>
			<li><b>CODE</b> -- translate the algorithm into Python code. This 
			step includes the development of an effective <b>user interface</b> 
			that obtains required <b>inputs</b> from the user and displays 
			results (<b>output</b>).</li>
			<li><b>TEST</b> and <b>DEBUG</b> the program. How can you prove to 
			yourself (and others) that the program works for all expected and 
			unexpected inputs?</li>
			<li><b>DOCUMENT</b> the program. Documentation consists of all 
			materials that describe the program, its purpose, and how it 
			operates. Full documentation is an essential element of every 
			programming project.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This process is often actually expressed as a <b>cycle</b>, because 
		it may be necessary at any point to backtrack to an earlier step and 
		then move forward again. For example, testing may prove that the 
		algorithm is incorrect, necessitating a fall back to the design stage.&nbsp; 
		(Note that this description differs is some details from the one in 
		Section 2.1 in your textbook.&nbsp; I encourage you to read both 
		carefully.&nbsp; Together they may help you understand some of the 
		details of the process.)</p>
		<p>Let's take a closer look at each step in the process, especially as 
		it applies to the work you will do this quarter.</p>
		<h4>1. Analyze the Problem </h4>
		<p>The goal of the first step in the process is to fully understand the 
		objectives of the program. Most projects begin as a <b>specification</b> 
		from a 'customer'. In general, the initial specification may be 
		incomplete, inconsistent, or even impossible -- or, the programmer may 
		simply not understand what is needed. An initial specification is just a 
		starting point, and must be interpreted, refined and completed by the 
		programmer in consultation with the customer. Once both parties are in 
		agreement about what the program will do, the project can continue.</p>
		<p>Also in this step, the programmer needs to convert the narrative 
		specification into a list of specific programming tasks -- outputs that 
		need to be provided and inputs that need to be obtained from the user. 
		In the next step, we will consider the processing steps (e.g. 
		calculations) that need to be performed in order to produce the required 
		outputs from the inputs provided. </p>
		<p>In this course, a homework assignment serves as a specification and 
		your instructor is the customer! Fortunately, this customer is very 
		experienced at writing good specifications, so you should not have 
		difficulties with 'inconsistent' or 'impossible'
		<img border="0" src="images/smiley.gif" width="15" height="15">. Your 
		primary objective will be to make sure you <i>understand</i> what the 
		assignment requires. If you are uncertain about the requirements or have 
		questions about some aspect of the specification (assignment), then you 
		need to seek clarification (e.g. post a message in the Discussion 
		Forum). </p>
		<h4>2. Design an Algorithm to Solve the Problem</h4>
		<p>In order to program a computer to solve a problem, you need to have a 
		plan -- <b>a logical sequence of precise steps that solves the problem</b> 
		-- an <b><u>algorithm</u></b>! This may be as simple as a formula, or it 
		may be a complex procedure involving decisions and repetition. 
		Developing an algorithm that solves the problem is what the design step 
		is all about! </p>
		<p>For most of our programs, it will be useful to employ a general 
		pattern that breaks the program down into 3 or 4 regions. The primary 
		regions are </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Input</b> -- get some information from the user</li>
			<li><b>Processing</b> -- calculate something or perform other 
			processing (<i>implement</i> the algorithm)</li>
			<li><b>Output</b> -- display calculated results to the user</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An additional region may be needed before any of these -- a section 
		at the top of the Python program where values are assigned to <b>
		constants</b> for use throughout the program. <b>A <u>constant</u> is 
		simply a variable whose value is assigned one time and never changed.</b> 
		By giving the constant a meaningful name, and then using that name 
		wherever the special value is needed, a program is made more reliable. 
		The 'Boxes' sample program is an example that employs all four of these 
		regions.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="images/FlowChartForProgramDevelopmentNote.gif" width="135" height="363" align="right">For 
		programs with any level of complexity, and especially for programs that 
		depart from a simple 'linear' flow (something that will be possible as 
		soon as we study selection statements), it is sensible to use some kind 
		of design tool to help visualize the 'flow' of the program as it is 
		executed. One such tool is a <b>flow chart</b> (see example at right). A 
		flow chart makes use of different kinds of boxes (or '<b>blocks</b>') to 
		represent each step in the execution of a program, and <b>flow lines</b> 
		to show the flow of control between blocks. Program flow is always in 
		the direction of the arrows, so steps are executed in a particular 
		order. In general, <b>if the steps of a program are executed out of 
		order, the program will not produce the same results</b>. <b><u>Order 
		matters!</u></b> Flow charts help the programmer visualize the order of 
		execution. Consider using a tool like this if it helps you visualize the 
		operation of your program. Flow charts are more valuable when programs 
		contain control structures like selection structures and loops, which we 
		will cover later this quarter.</p>
		<p>Another, more popular design tool is <b><u>pseudocode</u>: an outline 
		for a program written in a form that can be easily converted into actual 
		code.</b> There are no syntax rules for pseudocode. Rather, think of it 
		as a shorthand description of the program steps written <b>in the order 
		they will be performed</b>. Writing out the steps in shorthand before 
		actually writing code actually saves time, because corrections can be 
		made without struggling with error messages. Once the pseudocode seems 
		correct, it can be converted into actual code.</p>
		<p>One popular and valuable technique is to write pseudocode in the form 
		of a series of short comments. <b>These comments then form a guide for 
		writing the actual code</b>, and can remain in place as a reminder of 
		what the code is supposed to do. This is a great way to avoid the 
		problem of accidentally skipping a step in a program!</p>
		<p>No particular planning technique will be enforced in this course, but 
		whichever approach you choose to use, be sure to plan your programs 
		carefully before you begin writing code -- you'll be glad you did!</p>
		<h4>3. Write the Code</h4>
		<p>Coding is the process of translating the algorithm into a set of 
		Python statements. Because of the possibility of introducing syntax 
		errors, I recommend developing your programs progressively -- <b>add 
		just a few lines at a time, then test the program to make sure it still 
		works</b>. This means you are always working from a known-good program. 
		If adding just one line causes the program to generate an error, you 
		have a good idea where to look for the problem! </p>
		<h4>4. Test and Debug</h4>
		<p><b>Every program needs to be tested!</b> The purpose of <b>testing</b> 
		is to prove that the program produces the correct results for given sets 
		of input values. This means <b>trying some inputs, then independently 
		confirming that the results are correct</b> (by performing calculations 
		by hand, for example). When choosing input values to test, consider both 
		'typical' data and also any special cases. We will talk more about 
		testing as we work with different kinds of programming problems.</p>
		<p><b>Debugging</b> is the process of locating and correcting any errors 
		(&quot;bugs&quot;) in the program. If testing turns up a problem, then the 
		debugging process begins. One of the most important tools in debugging 
		is the ability to observe the values of variables at different points in 
		the program. Consider adding temporary statements that show the value of 
		a variable at a place in the code where you suspect a problem. Once the 
		problem is solved, these temporary statements can be removed (or maybe 
		just 'commented out' so they can be used again in the future if needed).
		</p>
		<h4>5. Documentation</h4>
		<p>The purpose of documentation is to provide a record of how the 
		problem was solved and how the resulting program works. In this course, 
		we will keep it simple. Your documentation should consist of the 
		following: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A standard block comment at the beginning of the program showing 
			the <b>file name</b>, a <b>brief description</b> of the program, 
			your <b>name</b>, the <b>assignment number</b>, and the <b>date</b>.</li>
			<li>A small number of 'inline comments' (comments embedded among the 
			lines of code) that provide information for only those things that 
			really need an explanation. Don't include inline comments just for 
			the sake of writing comments. Focus on saying <b>why</b> something 
			is being done, and not what is being done (which will be obvious to 
			other programmers anyway). Sometimes you don't need any inline 
			comments!</li>
			<li>A block comment at the <b>end</b> of the program that shows <b>
			documented test cases</b>: a set of tests performed (inputs used and 
			output produced) and an explanation of why you feel this testing 
			proves that the program is working correctly. The 'Mileage' and 
			'Boxes' sample programs demonstrate the use of documented test 
			cases.</li>
		</ul>
