Important Note About Program Structure</b></span></p>
<p>Up until now we have used a pretty basic structure for our programs: input 
--&gt; processing --&gt; output.&nbsp; You can see this structure very clearly in the 
&quot;Boxes&quot; sample program, and hopefully you have employed it in Assignment #2.&nbsp; 
This pattern will continue to be valuable to us in the future.&nbsp; However, 
now that we will be using programmer-defined functions, it will be useful to 
impose another layer of organization on our programs.&nbsp; Please follow the 
structure defined here in all programs that make use of programmer-defined 
functions.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The function definitions in your program should be listed one after 
	another in sequence.&nbsp; Do not place one function definition inside of 
	another.&nbsp; If you follow all the recommendations listed here, you may 
	place your function definitions in any order, except that the 'main' 
	function should be listed either first or last.&nbsp; Choose an order for 
	your function definitions that makes sense to you and helps a reader 
	understand the program.</li>
	<li>Each function definition should be preceded by a comment block that 
	describes what the function does and provides information about any required 
	parameters.</li>
	<li>In general, no global variables should be used in your programs unless 
	specifically authorized in an assignment.&nbsp; This is just good 
	programming practice.&nbsp; There will be occasional appropriate exceptions 
	to this rule, as you will see in the GuiTest3.py code.</li>
	<li>Global constants may be used if appropriate.&nbsp; The names of global 
	constants should be shown in all upper-case letters with underscores between 
	words, like this: CONTRIBUTION_RATE.</li>
	<li>The names of functions and local variables should follow one of two 
	patterns: all lower case (e.g. calculate_tip, total_to_pay) or &quot;camel case&quot; 
	(e.g. calculateTip, totalToPay).&nbsp; Notice that variable and function 
	names always should begin with a lower-case letter.</li>
	<li>Always use a function named 'main' as the entry point for your program.&nbsp; 
	As stated above, the 'main' function should be either the first or the last 
	function defined.</li>
	<li>The last statement in the program, and in general the only statement 
	that is not contained inside a function definition, should call the 'main' 
	function:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
	main()</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these rules will help you avoid confusing errors.&nbsp; Because 
Python is an interpreted programming language, it must read a function 
definition before it can process a call to that function.&nbsp; This rule could 
force you to place the function definitions is a specific order.&nbsp; However, 
if the call to 'main' is the only statement outside of a function definition, 
and if you place that call as the last line of your program, you can list your 
function definitions in any order.</p>
<p>Sample program 5.15 on page 238 in the text (page 194 in the Third Edition) demonstrates the use of the 
guidelines listed above.</p>
