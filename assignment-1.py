# nouns
# verbs

# adverbs

# Program requirements:
# =========================================
# at least 3 sentences
# at least 6 words
# 
# When your program starts, have it print a message to welcome the user to your game.
# 
# Next, the program prompts the user for each word, one at a time. Make sure the program 
#   tells the user what type of word to enter with each prompt.
# 
# Once the user has entered the last word, the program should print the story with the 
#   user's words inserted into the story in the correct places.
#       Important NOTE: Your output will NOT show any words underlined or bold or in italics 
#           as you see above.  I have added that formatting here just to make it clear which words 
#           are being replaced in the output with the user's choices.
