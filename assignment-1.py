# Written Report
# =========================================
#   How did you go about starting this assignment?
#       Couldn't figure out what to write about, went in circles
#   How did you come up with your story?
#       Just made up whatever at the last minute
#   How did you test your program?  
#       Manually
#   What works and what doesn't?
#       The program works, the story doesn't
#   What did you learn from this assignment?
#       I'm not a creative story teller
#   What would you do differently next time?
#       Ask for a different assignment, like calculating astronomical distances
#           in miles to our nearest neighbors in space... that would be cool
