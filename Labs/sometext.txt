Here's how to use a string variable as an accumulator to complete Part 6. First, be sure 
to inititalze the accumulator before the loop to an empty string (two quote marks with 
nothing between them, not even a space).  Then, instead of printing each character one at 
a time, add each character to the accumulator. When you reach the end of a word, print 
out the word (or a substitute), and then reset the accumulator to an empty string.  (In 
other situations, you may choose to add a newline character ('\n') to the accumulator to 
go to a new line, and then just print out the string accumulator's value one time after 
the loop is finished.)
